# Learn-To-Code-My-Answers
This repository contains my answers to the in-book and bonus exercises to Dr. Daniel Zingaro's book "Learn to Code by Solving Problems"

Each of the chapters are separated into their own subfolder; each subfolder contains both the exercises found in the book proper and the ones on this site: https://www.danielzingaro.com/ltc//menu/exercises.html
